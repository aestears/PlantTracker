Description: This package contains functions to extract growth, survival, 
  and local neighborhood density information from repeated, fine-scale maps of 
  organism occurence. Further information about this package can be found in our 
  journal article, "plantTracker: An R package to translate maps of plant 
  occurrence into demographic data" published in 2022 in Methods in Ecology and 
  Evolution (Stears, et al., 2022) <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13950>.
