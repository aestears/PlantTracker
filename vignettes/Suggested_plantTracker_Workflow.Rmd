Welcome to plantTracker! This package was designed to transform long-term 
quadrat maps that show plant occurence and size into demographic data that can 
be used to answer questions about population and community ecology. 
This vignette is designed to help you use plantTracker functions to move from a 
spatially referenced dataset containing plant cover data, to an output dataset 
that contains growth and survival data for each observed individual. 
```{r setup}
library(PlantTracker)
```
